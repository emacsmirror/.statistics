- The ~Mirror~ column specifies where the Emacsmirror mirrors a package
  from.  This should be ~orphaned~, meaning that the mirror gets it from
  here, or an empty string, which means that the package is not
  mirrored.

- The ~Melpa~ column specifies where Melpa gets a package from.  This
  matches the fetcher in the Melpa recipe, except if Melpa gets it
  from here, then ~orphaned~ is used instead of ~github~.  If this is an
  empty string, then the package is not available from Melpa.

- Sometimes the reason given here might not be correct.  Please do not
  be offended by that and keep in mind how much work it is to maintain
  the Emacsmirror.  Errors happen.  Please inform me about mistakes.

Reasons:

1. Sadly there is one package where "orphan" has a more literal
   meaning than what I had in mind when I created the Emacs Orphanage.
   RIP FranÃ§ois.

2. The upstream repository or file download for these packages has
   disappeared.

   Or at least it wasn't available for a long time; in some cases the
   upstream might be available again.  I do not check to make sure
   this is not the case.  If you find such a package, then please let
   me know.

   Of course there are many more packages whose upstream has
   disappeared, then those listed here, many of which can be found on
   the Emacsattic.

   Those unmaintained packages that made it into the orphanage instead
   of just the attic, did so because other mirrored packages depend on
   them, and/or because they are available from Melpa (I mirror all
   packages that are available from there).
   
3. The upstream repository or file download for these packages still
   exists (or at least still existed when being added here), but these
   packages have issues that have to be fixed and the maintainer did
   not respond when I contacted them about that.  I have patched these
   packages here in the orphanage to fix these issues. 

   Some of the upstream repositories or file downloads might have
   disappeared since I have done that.

4. These packages where officially dropped of by the former
   maintainer, in the hope that a new maintainer can be found.

5. The tools used to maintain the Emacsmirror do not support ~bzr~, ~cvs~,
   ~darcs~, ~fossil~, or importing from a tarball.  So I manually import
   the upstream repositories/tarballs into a ~git~ repository on the
   orphanage and then import the resulting ~git~ repositories as if that
   were the actual upstream.

   I do not regularly update these repositories.  If you find that
   they are outdated, then please let me know.  However many of these
   package repositories have not seen a commit in a decade.

6. ~apel~, ~flim~, ~semi~, and ~wanderlust~ are in the orphanage temporarily.

   ~wanderlust~ is still maintained by its upstream, and forks of the
   other packages are maintained by the ~wanderlust~ maintainers.

   However these packages have *many* feature conflicts and it looks
   like it's me who has to fix that.  Once I am done with that I will
   try to get those changes merged into the ~wanderlust~ repositories.

7. ~linkd~ is distributed on the Emacswiki.  Beside the library it also
   consists of images.  The tools used to maintain the Emacsmirror
   don't support this, so I have imported this manually.  The library
   has not been touched on the Emacswiki in some years, it can be
   considered unmaintained.

8. The upstream of ~picolisp~ only dumps releases as tarballs and
   contact information is obfuscated.  The library headers don't
   conform to the conventions at all, and due to how this is
   distributed, I have little confidence in my fixes getting
   integrated.  But I should at least try, and eventually I will.

9. These packages are being distributed on the Emacswiki and other
   packages that are not distributed on the Emacswiki depend on them.
   Anyone can edit packages on the Emacswiki, which is a big security
   risk, so eventually we want to remove those packages from Melpa.
   Not importing these packages from the wiki anymore is a step into
   that direction.  Also see Melpa issue
   [#2342](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/2342).
